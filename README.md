Course: CS601 Fall 2 2023

For this assignment, I implemented all the basic functionality required of us. I also added a few extra features and some CSS styling. 
The .json file was created correctly and contains all the data needed for this assignment. The HTML file here is very simple because all of the functionality was done using JavaScript in the .js file. The script was imported into the HTML file at the end of the body section to ensure the DOM is fully loaded before the JS code is executed. The main.js file starts with retrieving the button created in the .html file and attach functionality to it. The function starts with a fetch of the data from the .json file. The data is received, and if everything was properly received, the data is then processed using the code in the .js file. The data is output as a table format (code shown in main.js). The DOM is updated after the button is clicked showing the filled-out table. The CSS styling was used to apply a color palette shown in the discussion and to create a smooth feel for the simple website.

How to Run:
    There are two ways to run this file:
    1. File can be run the regular way by opening in an IDE, then right clicking on .html file and "Open with Live Server" to run in the browser.
    2. All files have been uploaded to a GitHub repository, and GitHub Pages was used to host the files on a server at the following URL: https://hirmezb1996.github.io/CS601_HW5_Hirmez/. Simply open the URL, and the website will be running as intended.


Lastly, the CSS, JSON, and HTML codes have been validated and no errors were found.
